This Website is for my Individual assignment in Javascript. It is a Website for IE-Gamers, where several Products are displayed. These procuts include Computers, Chases, and accesseries. You can click on these and add them to the cart. You can add them to the cart and delete them by writing 0.
In my Javascript COde I implented wit vanilla JS and JQuery:
Navbar toggling: The code toggles the visibility of the navigation bar when the menu icon is clicked. It also changes the menu icon to an 'X' icon and vice versa.

Header active class: When scrolling, it adds the "header-active" class to the header element if the scroll position is more than 68 pixels from the top. This could change the appearance of the header, such as its background color or size.

Active navigation link highlighting: It sets the 'active' class to the appropriate navigation link based on the user's scroll position relative to different sections of the page.

Home slider: The code initializes the Owl Carousel plugin for the home slider, with various settings such as auto-play, loop, and navigation controls.

Product image gallery: It allows users to click on small product images to display a larger version of the image.

Filtering gallery items: Users can filter gallery items by clicking buttons with specific data-filter attributes. The filtered items will be shown, and others will be hidden.

Shopping cart functionality: It implements a basic shopping cart feature. When users click the "Add to Cart" button, the cart object is updated with the item's information, and the cart's total is recalculated. The updated cart object is then saved to localStorage.

Cart item count and alert: The code keeps track of the number of items added to the cart, displays the count on the page, and shows a temporary success alert when an item is added to the cart.
